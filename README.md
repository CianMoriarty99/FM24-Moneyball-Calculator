# FM24-Moneyball-Calculator

This is a python script that reads a CSV of player statistics, and calculates a single moneyball number based on how close they are to the production of "Elite" players in Football Manager 24.

Remember that production is relative to the standard of play - someone with a 100% tackle rate in the Vanorama League probably won't produce 100% tackle rate in the Premier League.

Run 'python app.py' to start the program, it will be hosted locally (for now) on localhost:5000

There is a sample CSV file in the repo you can upload to try it out
